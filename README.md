# Week 1: Pandas for Data Wrangling

Welcome to the assignment for `Pandas for Data Wrangling` in Week 1 of EE16ML.
This repository and the contained files have been created by team **DSS**, consisting of Kevin Miao, Sandeep Sainath Youngli Hong, and Amanda Ma.

## Pre-requisites

Before you start this assignment, we assume the following pre-requisite knowledge:

- CS61A and CS61B or any similar programming experience
  - Object-Oriented Programming
  - Data Structures
  - Proficiency in Python

- Recommended: Introductory machine learning knowledge

## Environment Set Up

For this module, we will be both working with **DataHub/Jupyter Notebook**. Please refer to [this link](https://jupyter.org/install) to get more information on how to run **Jupyter** locally.

## Learning Objectives

After this week, you should:

- be able to import and clean raw data in CSV, Excel, or JSON formats.
- be familiar with the basic data structures in Pandas such as DataFrames and Series.
- be familiar with the basics of data manipulation in Pandas such as subsetting, selecting, and filtering data.
- be able to perform complex data operations in Pandas such as groupbys, pivots, and joins and understand the intuition behind them.
- be able to draw on common use cases of Pandas in the context of practical machine learning
- in general, be very comfortable with the fundamentals of Pandas for data wrangling.

## Module Structure

The module will consists of:
- documentation covering all the material for learning Pandas
- a slide deck summarizing the most important information in the documentation
- a short quiz designed to assess passing-level understanding of the material
- coding assignments

You are expected to read through the notes and the slide deck before starting the assignments. At the end, you will be able to test whether you retained enough information to be at passing level through taking the quiz.
